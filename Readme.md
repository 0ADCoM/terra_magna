0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. But you already knew that. Let's
get to how you'll be installing our mod.

If you're interested in helping us out, we'd love to hear from you! We could
always use another helping hand with the project, and you can help us get
one step closer to introducing the Chinese faction to the game in its
entirety! There are several ways to contact us and find more information:

Reporting problems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there shouldn't be any bugs in this release, as it's quite simply
a bunch of art assets and actors, if you experience any issues, please tell us about
it on the Wildfiregames Forum!

As always, if you experience problems with the game itself, Wildfire Games would 
really appreciate it if you'd tell them about it on Trac: trac.wildfiregames.com/
After searching to make sure it's not a duplicate, just register a new ticket and
the team will get to fixing it!
