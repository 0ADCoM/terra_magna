====================== 0 A.D. : Rise of the East Information ======================







0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
, real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. But you already knew that. 
Let's 
get to how you'll be installing our mod. 


If you're interested in helping us out, we'd love to hear from you! 
We could 
always use another helping hand with the project, and you can help us get 
one step closer to introducing the Chinese faction to the game in it s
entirety!
There are several ways to contact us and find more information:

----------------------- 
Installing the mod folder 
-----------------------------------




Before installing the mod, we assume that  you already have the lastest official version of 0ad! If not, you can grab it here: http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/ !
At the present momment, the instalation is prety simple and easy to do!
Just open the "binaries\data\mods" folder and copy the "\china" folder or zip archive here! 
Congratulations! You have just installed Rise of The East mod!






------------------------ 
Running the mod 
---------------------------------------------





Currently, the game will not auto-detect that a new mod folder is present.
 Though this will be a feature in the future, as of Alpha VIII it is not. 
For the 
time being, you'll need to run the game via the command line (or on UNIX,
Terminal), where "china" is the name of the mod folder or archive:
 

 -> Windows: ./pyrogenesis.exe -mod=china

 -> UNIX: ./pyrogenesis_dbg -mod=china

 

Alternatively, you may rename your 'china' folder to 'internal' in the interim and 
the game will load the data automatically, although it's not reccomended, since it can break the original game. 
If you have any questions, please contact
us at support@sciondevelopment.com.



--------------------------
Reporting problems
-------------------------------------------





Although there shouldn't be any bugs in this first release, as it's quite simply 
a bunch of art assets and actors, if you experience any issues, please tell us about 
it on the forums (http://forum.sciondevelopment.com/)!


As always, if you experience problems with the game itself, Wildfire Games would 
really appreciate it if you'd tell them about it on Trac: trac.wildfiregames.com/

After searching to make sure it's not a duplicate, just register a new ticket and
 the team will get to fixing it!
 
Alternatively, you can go to their forums (http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/) to discuss and report any issues you may encounter, since the game is still in the Alpha Stage.
